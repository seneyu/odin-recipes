    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 baguette french</li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
      <li>black pepper</li>
      <li>8 ounces fig jam</li>
      <li>10 ounces brie sliced into 2-inch long rectangles</li>
      <li>10 ounces prosciutto thinly sliced</li>
      <li>10 figs quartered</li>
      <li>thyme fresh</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice the baguette into Â½-inch thick slices. In a small bowl, combine
        olive oil with some salt and pepper. Brush each slice of bread with
        olive oil, then briefly toast in toaster oven or under the broiler in
        the oven until just golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread fig jam on each toast, then top with a slice of brie. If desired,
        pop the toasts back in the toaster oven or under the broiler for about
        1-2 minutes until brie is melty.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you melted the brie, once the toasts have been removed from the
        toaster or oven, top them each with 1 slice of prosciutto, folding it on
        to itself so that it fits on the baguette slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top each with 1-2 fresh fig quarters, a sprinkle of thyme, additional
        black pepper, and enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
