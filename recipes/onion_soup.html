    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 large red or yellow onions</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>8 cups beef stock, chicken stock or a combination of the two</li>
      <li>1/2 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brandy</li>
      <li>8 slices French baguette</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups grated Gruyere cheese</li>
      <li>Sprinkling grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and thinly slice the onions from root to stem. There should be
        about 10 cups of sliced onions in total.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on
        medium heat. Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive oil. Cook
        the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to 20
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive
        oil and the butter and cook, stirring often, until the onions start to
        brown, about 20 to 40 minutes. The amount of time will vary depending on
        your pot, stove, and onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. Continue to cook until the
        onions are well browned, about 10 to 15 more minutes. Add the minced
        garlic and cook for a minute more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the wine or vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on
        the bottom and sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot
        and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper.
        Discard the bay leaves. Add brandy.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or
        foil and preheat the oven to 450Â°F with a rack in the upper third of the
        oven. Brush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly
        with olive oil. Put in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5
        to 7 minutes. Remove from oven. Turn the toasts over and sprinkle with
        the grated Gruyere cheese and Parmesan. Return to oven when it's close
        to serving time and bake until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle soup into a bowl and transfer one cheesy toast onto the top of
        each bowl of soup.
      </li>
    </ol>
